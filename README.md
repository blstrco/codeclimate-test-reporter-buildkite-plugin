# codeclimate-test-reporter-buildkite-plugin

A BuildKite plugin

https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/plugins

to report coverage with the Code Climate test reporter

https://github.com/codeclimate/test-reporter

Initial design only handles single, not parallel, tests.

Also see: https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-test-coverage

## Usage:

This plugin will download a build artifact generated by a previous step, compile and report to Code Climate.

Note: It runs as a [Command step](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/command-step), but the command is ignored.

```
steps:
  - command: "Report Code Climate Coverage"
    label: ":codeclimate: Report coverage"
    plugins:
      jobready/codeclimate-test-reporter#v1.0.0:
        prefix: /app
        artifact: "coverage/.resultset.json"
        input_type: simplecov
        version: "0.4.3"
    env:
      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID:
```
